A Python-based project for fine-tuning the T5 model on a summarization task using the Hugging Face transformers library. The project uses the XSum dataset to train a model that generates summaries from text articles.

Key Features:

T5 model fine-tuning for text summarization.
PyTorch and Hugging Face transformers for NLP.
XSum dataset integration.
